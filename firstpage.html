<h1>Brooke-Lynne Howe</h1>
<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Brooke and I’m currently a Computer Science student at UCF who’s taking transient courses at <a href="https://valenciacollege.edu">Valencia</a>. I enjoy programming (C and Python) and am excited to learn more about the web development side of things. I am interested in all aspects of computer science though, and plan on eventually joining UCF’s robotics team and Hack @UCF. </p>

<p>Besides Computer Science, I also enjoy:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>Reading</li>
  <li>Surfing</li>
  <li>Cooking</li>
  <li>Traveling</li>
</ul>
I am also an animal lover and am the parent to a 1 year-old kitten named Luna and I volunteer
 at pet shelters in my spare time. I love both practicing and teaching yoga and my record for longest
  headstand held is 3 minutes and 11 seconds. The goal is to <em>one day</em> get to five minutes.</p>

<h2>My Favorites:</h2>
  <p><b>My favorite quote is:</b>
    <blockquote>"Nobody can save you but yourself.
  You will be put again and again into nearly impossible situations.
  They will attempt again and again to make you submit, quit, and/or die quietly inside... and it will
  be easy enough to fail... but don't, don't, don't. Just watch them. Listen to them. Do you want
  to be like that? A faceless, mindless, heartless being? Do you want to experience death before
  death? Nobody can save you but yourself and you're worth saving. It's a war not easily won
  but if anything is worth winning then this is it. Think about it. Think about saving yourself."</blockquote>

  <p><b>My favorite book is: </b>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
      <li><em>1984</em> by George Orwell</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>My favorite food is: </b>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>Sushi (<b>Especially</b> the Volcano Roll, but I love all kinds.)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>My favorite movie is: </b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
          <li><em>The Prestige</em> -- It's chilling, and quite honestly, a work of genius.</li>
        </ul>
